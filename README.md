# Age of War plugin
This plugin is a based on the old flash game Age of War (the first one) some elements differ from the original game.\
The goal of the game is to defend your base while trying to destroy your opponent base.

## About the original game
Originally released in 2007 by Louissi, Age of War became a timeless classic, with many regarding it as the birth of the popularization of flash games. In these base defense games, you play as a defender of your base and spawn units which act as both defense and offence, marching linearly across the map to the opponent's (an AI) base. If a base's hit points (HP) drop to zero, the opponent wins. As such, the objective of the game is to reduce the opponent's base HP to zero.
